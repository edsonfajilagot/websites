Or it's device which can store the information/data/music/picture/movie/sound/book; In fact what ever you store in computer it must be inform of file. Files are always associated with devices like hard disk ,floppy disk etc. File is the last object in your file system tree.&nbsp;</p><p>In Linux files have different types like&nbsp;</p><ul><li> Executable files&nbsp;&nbsp; (stored in /bin, /usr/bin)</li><li> Special files (stored in /dev)</li><li> Configuration files (stored in /etc)</li><li> Directory&nbsp;</li><li> User files or ordinary files etc&nbsp;</li></ul><p> And the process which manage the Files i.e. creation, deletion, copying of files and giving read, write access of files to user is called <u> File management</u>.&nbsp;</p><p> Normally you can perform following operation on files&nbsp;</p><ul><li> Copy file&nbsp;</li><li> Delete file&nbsp;</li><li> Rename file&nbsp;</li><li> Move file&nbsp;</li><li> Changing file date &amp; time stamp&nbsp;</li><li> Creating symbolic link&nbsp;</li><li> Changing file permission or ownership&nbsp;</li><li> Searching files&nbsp;</li><li> Compressing / Decompressing files&nbsp;</li><li>Comparison between files&nbsp;</li><li> Printing files on printer&nbsp;</li><li> Sorting files etc</li></ul><p><big><b><a name=whatdiris></a>What directory is?&nbsp;<br> </b></big>Directory is group of files. Directory is divided into two types as</p><p>(1) <u>Root directory</u> : Strictly speaking, there is only one root directory in your system, which is shown by / (forward slash), which is root of your entire file system. And can not be renamed or deleted.<br> (2) <u>Sub directory</u> : Directory under root (/) directory is subdirectory which can be created, rename by the user.&nbsp; For e.g. bin is subdirectory which is under / (root) directory.<br> Directories are used to organize your data files, programs more efficiently.&nbsp;</p><p>When you install Linux (Red Hat ver. 6.x), by default following directories are created by Linux</p><p align=center> <img border=0 src=images/filesys.gif width=178 height=352><br></p> <table border=1 width=100% cellspacing=1 cellpadding=1 align=center><tr bgcolor=#CCCCCC><td width=19% align=center><b>Directory Name</b></td><td width=81% align=center><b>Use to store this kind of files</b></td></tr><tr><td width=19%>/bin</td><td width=81%>All your essential program (executable files) which can be use by most of the user are store here. For e.g. vi, ls program are store here.</td></tr><tr><td width=19% height=20>/sbin</td><td width=81% height=20>All super user executable (binaries) files are store which is mostly used by root user . As mentioned in Red Hat Linux documentation: &quot;<i>The executables in /sbin are only used to boot and mount /usr and perform system recovery operations.</i>&quot;</td></tr><tr><td width=19%>/home</td><td width=81%>Your sweet home. Mostly you work here. All the user have their own subdirectory under this directory.</td></tr><tr><td width=19% height=2>/etc</td><td width=81% height=2><p>Configuration file of your Linux system are here. For e.g. smb.conf - Samba configuration file. It may contained sub directories like xinetd.d or X11 which contains more configuration files related to particular application or program. See the <a href=images/fig01.html>rest of subdirectories</a>.<br></p></td></tr><tr><td width=19%>/lost+found</td><td width=81%>When your system crashes, this is the place where you will get your files. For e.g. You have shutdown your computer without unmounting the file system. Next time when your computer starts all your 'fsck' program try to recover you file system, at that time some files may stored here and may be removed from original location so that you can still find those file here.&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td width=19% height=17>/var</td><td width=81% height=17>Mostly the file(s) stored in this directory changes their size i.e. variable data files. Data files including spool directories and files, administrative and logging data, and transient and temporary files etc.</td></tr><tr><td width=19% height=27>/usr</td><td width=81% height=27><p>Central location for all your application program, x-windows, man pages, documents etc are here. Programs meant to be used and shared by all of the users on the system. Mostly you need to export this directory using NFS in read-only mode. Some of the important sub-directories are as follows:<br> <b>bin</b> - sub-directory contains executables<br> <b>sbin</b> - sub-directory contains files for system administration i.e. binaries<br> <b>include</b> - sub-contains C header files<br> <b>share</b> - sub-contains contains files that aren't architecture-specific like documents, wallpaper etc.<br> <b>X11R6</b> - sub-contains X Window System</p></td></tr><tr><td width=19% height=30>/lib</td><td width=81% height=30>All shared library files are stored here.

It's called drive, which is nothing but group of all directories and the drive name is given according to disk type by MS-DOS Os. For e.g. First floppy drive on IBM PC is A: (Read as A drive), Second is B: etc. When you want to use floppy you insert floppy disk into floppy drive and simply change drive later to A: as follows</p><p><b>C:\&gt; A:</b></p><p><b>A:\&gt; DIR</b></p><p>This is the feature of MS-DOS/Windows 9x Os.

In fact many of the directories in the tree are physical devices like cd rom , floppy disk, OR partition of hard-disk.(may be partition of different remote computer). When such disk (floppy,cdrom etc) OR partition is attached to the file tree at a directory know as <u>mount point</u> and all files below that are referred as <u>file system</u>.&nbsp;</p><p>/dev directory under Linux contains special files which are require to access hardware devices such as floppy disk, CD-ROM disk, Another partition, tape drive etc.</p><p>For e.g.</p><p><u>IDE Devices (CD-ROM/RW or Hard Disk etc)</u></p><p><u>/dev/hdx</u>&nbsp; -- Where x is the first IDE physical hard disk connected to your system.
